Running the BBBike CGI on a webserver
=====================================

Following instructions apply for Apache2, and may also work for
Apache1.3.

Installing dependencies
=======================

Debian
------

If you're on a Debian (preferable Debian/squeeze) or Debian-similar
system (e.g. Ubuntu), then you can install all optionally needed
packages for CGI operations with:

    (assuming you are currently in the cgi subdirectory of the bbbike
    directory)
    (as unprivileged user)
        cd ..
        perl Makefile.PL
    (do not be alarmed by the many warnings)

    (then as root or using sudo)
        apt-get update
        make install-debian-packages-for-cgi

Install a suitable webserver. Currently recommended is apache2, but
other cgi-capable webservers may also work.

    (as root)
    apt-get install apache2

Other Linux/Unix systems
------------------------

On other systems, you have to install at least:
- apache2
- make
- the perl module Template-Toolkit (probably the package is called
  p5-Template or perl-Template-Toolkit or so)
Maybe other packages are needed. Alternatively CPAN.pm may be used to
install perl module dependencies:
    cpan Bundle::BBBike_cgi

Creating Apache configuration
=============================

    cd cgi
    make httpd.conf

Then follow the instructions to include the generated configuration
file into the main httpd.conf.

Restart the Apache and point your browser to

    http://localhost/bbbike
