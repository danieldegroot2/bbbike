README for tkbabybike

A route-finder for cyclists in Berlin and Brandenburg - the handheld
version.

This application should run with familiar 0.4 (see
http://www.handhelds.org). You also need perl and Perl/Tk.
Pre-compiled versions of perl and Perl/Tk can be found in:

	ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/S/SR/SREZIC

You need three perl distributions in this directory:

* perl-5.005-minimal-bin-0-arm-linux.tar.gz
* perl-5.005-basicmods-bin-0-arm-linux.tar.gz
* perl-Tk-800.023-bin-0-arm-linux.tar.gz

These should be untarred in /. To make room on the flash, you can
remove the python binary and libraries :-)

The application can be installed with the ipkg manager program:

	ipkg install tkbabybike.ipk

For WindowsCE, you may take a look at this page for a Perl/Tk
distribution:

	http://www.rainer-keuchel.de/wince/perltk.html

However I never tried this distro with tkbabybike.

If you encounter problems, feel free to send a mail to
